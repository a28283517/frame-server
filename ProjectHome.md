Frameserving and Audioserving are the techniques used to transfer audio/video data from one application to another without doing a full fledged render and temporary files. Frameserver is a plugin for NLEs enabling them to export their timeline audio/video data outside so that other applications can use the timeline directly as input.

Another use of the Frameserver is to serve audio/video data to an application that does not understand the source format. If you have a video editor that can open .MOV files and your MPEG encoder can read only .AVI input files, you can open the .MOV file in your NLE and use Frameserver to serve the a/v data to your MPEG encoder. This increases compatibility between applications.

Frameserver can also export the video from your NLE as an Image sequence. Frames can be saved in lossless BMP, TIFF, PNG and high quality JPEG formats.
